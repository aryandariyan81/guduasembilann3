    <h3>Wilfred owens most famous poems are &#039;dulce et decorum est&#039;, &#039;mental cases&#039;, &#039;futility&#039;, &#039;disabled&#039;, &#039;anthem for doomed youth&#039;, &#039;the parable of the old men and the young&#039; these are his most famous poems and may he rest in peace.</h3>
    <p>What does owen&#039;s purposeful use of the extra foot add to the emotion of his poetry? Owen was very much encouraged by tailhade&#039;s favourable criticism of his early works, but still he was undecided as to the path he should choose in life. It is sweet and proper to. Wilfred owen was such a man but, tragically, his work was only published after his death.</p>
