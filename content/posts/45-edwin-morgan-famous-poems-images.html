    <h3>Using edwin morgan&#039;s poem the apple&#039;s song to inspire discussion and creative writing.</h3>
    <p>In 1999, morgan was made the first glasgow poet laureate. A public reading by morgan might involve poems such as the loch ness monster&#039;s song, with its sensitive rendering of the voice of the world&#039;s. Soon after his birth his parents decided to move to rutherglen, where he spent his childhood and attended a local school. Even the sonnet form becomes a new experiment for a poet of questing and anarchic vision, unwilling to rest on rules.</p>
